# PRODIGY_SD_04
 # Sudoku Solver in Java
This Java program is designed to automatically solve Sudoku puzzles using backtracking, a common technique for solving Sudoku grids.

The program takes an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and finds the correct arrangement of numbers to complete the puzzle.

Once solved, it displays the completed Sudoku grid.

Usage

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the Sudoku puzzle. You should input the puzzle as a 9x9 grid of numbers, where empty cells are represented by 0 (zero).

Press Enter, and the program will start solving the Sudoku puzzle.

Once the puzzle is solved, the program will display the completed Sudoku grid:

 # Algorithm

This program uses the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.

The backtracking algorithm works by systematically filling in numbers and undoing them when a dead-end is reached until a solution is found.
